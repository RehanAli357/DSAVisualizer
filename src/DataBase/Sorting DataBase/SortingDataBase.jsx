If any element is smaller than the selected element (for Ascending order), then both are swapped so that first position is filled with the smallest element in the sorted order. Next, we select the element at a second position in the list and it is compared with all the remaining elements in the list. If any element is smaller than the selected element, then both are swapped. This procedure is repeated until the entire list is sorted.',
    defi2: 'Insertion sort works similarly as we sort cards in our hand in a card game.We assume that the first card is already sorted then, we select an unsorted card. If the unsorted card is greater than the card in hand, it is placed on the right otherwise, to the left. In the same way, other unsorted cards are taken and put in their right place.A similar approach is used by insertion sort.',
    defi3: 'Bubble sort is a sorting algorithm that compares two adjacent elements and swaps them until they are in the intended order.Just like the movement of air bubbles in the water that rise up to the surface, each element of the array move to the end in each iteration. Therefore, it is called a bubble sort.'
